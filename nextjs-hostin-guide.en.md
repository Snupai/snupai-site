# How to Put Your New Website Online ‚Äì A Complete Beginner-Friendly Guide

## No worries ‚Äì it‚Äôs easier than it sounds!

Congratulations! Your website is finished and ready to be seen by the world. We built it with modern, professional tools that make it fast, secure, and reliable.

This guide walks you through the whole process step by step. You don‚Äôt need any technical knowledge. Just follow the recipe. In about 15‚Äì20 minutes, your site will be live on the internet.

## What are GitHub and Vercel? And why do we use them?

Think of building a house. You need two things: a detailed blueprint and a plot of land with a construction company that builds and opens the house to visitors.

In our digital world, it‚Äôs similar:

- **GitHub** = **The vault for your blueprint.**
  - GitHub is a highly secure place on the internet where all files and code for your website are stored. It‚Äôs like Google Drive or Dropbox, but designed for website projects.
  - The magic: GitHub remembers every single change ever made. If something goes wrong, we can always revert to a previous, working version. It‚Äôs the ultimate safety net.

- **Vercel** = **The land and the lightning-fast construction company.**
  - Vercel takes the blueprint from GitHub, ‚Äúbuilds‚Äù your website from it, and makes it available to the world. It‚Äôs much more than just hosting; it‚Äôs an automated process.
  - The magic: As soon as we update the blueprint on GitHub, Vercel notices immediately, rebuilds the site automatically, and puts the new version online‚Äîusually in under three minutes.

In short: GitHub stores the truth of your site, and Vercel shows it to the world. These two services work perfectly together and are used by major companies like Netflix, TikTok, Adobe, and McDonald‚Äôs. You get a truly professional setup‚Äîand the best part is that for most business sites, it‚Äôs free.

## Part 1: Activate your GitHub access (the vault)

### Step 1: Find the invitation email from GitHub

1. Open your email app. Look for an email from ‚ÄúGitHub.‚Äù Also check your spam/junk folder.
2. The subject will look like: ‚Äú[Developer Name] has invited you to collaborate on [your-website-name]‚Äù.
3. Click the big green button: ‚ÄúAccept invitation.‚Äù This confirms you‚Äôre the owner of the blueprint.

### Step 2: Create your free GitHub account (if you don‚Äôt have one)

1. Go to https://github.com.
2. Click the green ‚ÄúSign up‚Äù button (usually top right).
3. Enter your email address. Use the exact same address the invitation was sent to.
4. Create a secure password.
5. Choose a username.
6. Follow the remaining steps. You may need to solve a small puzzle to prove you‚Äôre human.
7. Confirm your email via the verification link.

### Step 3: Access your website files

1. After accepting the invite and logging in, you‚Äôll see a page with a list of files and folders.
2. This is your website‚Äôs ‚Äúrepository‚Äù‚Äîyour project folder with the entire blueprint inside.
3. Bookmark this page. It‚Äôs your central hub.
4. Don‚Äôt worry about the technical file names. Your developer set everything up.

## Part 2: Set up Vercel (the builder that puts your site live)

### Step 1: Create your free Vercel account

1. Go to https://vercel.com.
2. Click ‚ÄúSign Up.‚Äù
3. Choose ‚ÄúContinue with GitHub.‚Äù You‚Äôre giving Vercel permission to read your blueprint.
4. Authorize Vercel when GitHub asks.
5. That‚Äôs it‚Äîyou‚Äôre connected.

### Step 2: Import your site and go live

1. Vercel will list your GitHub projects automatically.
2. Find the one that matches your website and click ‚ÄúImport.‚Äù
3. On the configuration page, change nothing. The defaults match the code.
4. Scroll down and click ‚ÄúDeploy.‚Äù
5. Magic happens: Vercel fetches your code, builds the site, and deploys it to the global network in 2‚Äì3 minutes.

### Step 3: Your website is live!

1. You‚Äôll see a success message: ‚ÄúCongratulations! Your project has been deployed.‚Äù
2. Click ‚ÄúVisit.‚Äù
3. A new tab opens‚Äîyour live website!
4. Copy the URL (something like your-website-name.vercel.app).
5. Share the link with anyone.

## Part 3: Connect your own domain (e.g., www.my-company.com)

### Case A: You already own a domain

1. Go to your project in the Vercel dashboard.
2. Open ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù > ‚ÄúDomains.‚Äù
3. Enter your domain and click ‚ÄúAdd.‚Äù
4. Vercel shows one or two DNS records (A or CNAME) that you must add at your domain provider.
5. Log into your provider (Strato, IONOS, GoDaddy, etc.) and copy the records.
6. If unsure, take a screenshot and contact your provider‚Äôs support‚Äîthey can set the records for you.

### Case B: You need to buy a domain

1. Popular vendors: Strato, IONOS by 1&1, Namecheap, etc.
2. Buy the name you want.
3. Then follow Case A to connect it.

## Part 4: How updates work (the truly magical part)

Every time a change is saved on GitHub, Vercel rebuilds and updates the live site automatically. You do nothing.

### Optional: Make tiny text changes yourself

1. Go to your GitHub repository.
2. Navigate to the file with the text you want to change.
3. Click the pencil icon to edit in your browser.
4. Make your change.
5. Add a short note describing the change and click ‚ÄúCommit changes.‚Äù
6. Wait 2‚Äì3 minutes‚Äîyour live site updates automatically.

For anything bigger (design, new pages, new features), contact your developer.

## Part 5: Keep an eye on your site

1. Log in at https://vercel.com.
2. Open your project.
3. The dashboard shows deployments and basic stats.

Status light:
- Green: Everything is great.
- Yellow/Orange: A new update is building; wait a few minutes.
- Red: The last update failed. Don‚Äôt worry‚Äîthe live site still shows the last working version. Send your developer a screenshot.

---

## Part 6: If something goes wrong

- Try another browser or your phone to rule out cache issues.
- Check your project status in Vercel.
- If issues persist, contact your developer with a screenshot and a short description.

---

## Part 7: What does it cost?

For 99% of business sites, this professional setup is free:
- GitHub: unlimited storage for your code
- Vercel: generous free tier bandwidth
- Automatic SSL
- Global CDN

Consider a paid plan only if you have very high traffic.

---

## Part 8: Security and backups

- Versioning: every change is saved; nothing is lost.
- Reliability: Vercel offers excellent uptime.
- Security: no outdated plugins like in traditional CMS setups.
- SSL: encrypted by default.

Your action items:
1. Use strong, unique passwords for GitHub and Vercel.
2. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for both.

---

## Part 9: When to ask for help

Contact your developer if:
- You see a red error in Vercel
- The site is offline for more than 10 minutes
- You need design/content changes beyond tiny text edits

Helpful info to include:
- Screenshot of the error
- What you were doing when it occurred
- Your site URL
